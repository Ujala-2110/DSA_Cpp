// Topological sort is possible only in DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
// Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u  v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

// Difference between Topological sort and DFS
// In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of the stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack.

// Firstly node's childs are pushed into stack and then node itself, such that node will pop out first and then it's child.
// Topological sort is increasing order of indegree of node [0->1->2->3->4->5.. ] like that.
